# Team Wangan Fire and Smoke Detection Mini-Project with Machine Learning

**See fire. Stop fire. Our app's accuracy will never backfire.**

### A machine learning mini-project for use and research in effective fire protection and prevention through live image processing.

Team Wangan's web-based mini-project software is a sophisticated and advanced tool that can be used by private users and experts to ensure improved home, commercial property, and public safety with quick and reliable alerts **in case of fire**. 

Our machine-learning algorithms are **constantly trained** with data analyzed and gathered from different sources and datasets to provide the **most consistent and accurate** fire recognition and detection.

### Overview and Statement

Detection of fire and smoke in CCTV systems can significantly decrease the response time to such tragedies, saving many lives and properties.

This application, which works in an Internet browser, is **designed for future research and applications in CCTV systems**, especially those in private and commercial properties.

### Powered by ResNet-50

Machine learning is an integral part of the backend systems and algorithmic processes of this mini-project. Here, the model being used here is ResNet-50.

This is a classic neural network used as a backbone for many computer vision tasks. **A convolutional neural network that is 50 layers deep**, one can load a pretrained version of the neural network trained on more than a million images from the ImageNet database.

### The Power of the Convolutional Neural Network

ResNet50 has been shown to **produce high accuracy in various computer vision tasks**, including image classification, object detection, and segmentation. Its architecture, based on residual blocks and skip connections, makes it easier to train deeper networks without encountering the vanishing gradient problem or degradation in accuracy.

Main advantages: 
- **High accuracy in various computer vision tasks**
- **The ability to train deeper networks without encountering issues related to vanishing gradients or degradation in accuracy**
- **Reduced need for heavy computing resources due to transfer learning**

## What about conventional alarms and detectors?

This mini-project aims explore image recognition as an alternative - it is not meant to discount the ability of conventional sensors. In a large (and open) area, multiple conventional detectors need to be spread out throughout the place.

Light (and therefore, video footage) travels faster than hot air and smoke. Cameras (depending on the quality) can cover a wider area with less devices, and they can detect fire and smoke from a longer distance.

### What is this ideal for?

This app is ideal for gardens, cemeteries, warehouses, outdoor areas, plantations, forest areas, and similar properties.

Fire sensors have to detect a certain amount of temperature to be triggered. They are also limited by battery capacity.

This means that cameras can detect fire and smoke faster than sensors can detect hot air and smoke. Every second counts. The detection time difference may only be in seconds, but quick responses matters. 

### Road to Research

Join us on our groundbreaking journey at Team Wangan as we advance fire detection and prevention through cutting-edge technology. Our web-based mini-project software, **currently supporting image analysis**, represents a vital step in our ongoing research. 

While it holds tremendous potential, our ultimate goal is to **leverage live video footage** for even more robust fire recognition capabilities.

### Join and Support Us!

At Team Wangan, we are constantly pushing the boundaries of fire detection research. With a vision to harness live video footage in our app, we strive to unlock even greater potential in real-time fire recognition. **Be a part of our journey as we shape the future of fire safety.**
